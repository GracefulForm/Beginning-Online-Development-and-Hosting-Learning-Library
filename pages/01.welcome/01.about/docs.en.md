I teach full time, and after that, tinker with various open source projects. 

I remember getting online for the first time, and the excitement of starting out with web technologies and developing my first websites. I can't imagine what it would have been like to have all of the online resources that we have today. I want to use this library to give back to the community, help our new friends, keep the things I do the most cataloged in one place, and share my favorite places to get inexpensive or free resources. I never recommend any service that I don't use myself.
