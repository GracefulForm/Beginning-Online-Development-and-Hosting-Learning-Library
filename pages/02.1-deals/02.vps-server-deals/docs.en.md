## About RackNerd

I first found RackNerd when searching Black Friday deals for cheap VPS servers for some quick testing. The cost for a year was lower than my monthly bill where I was at the time, so I thought I would test them out to see about moving my sites over to them.

Here is what I found:

* Their prepay VPS was faster than my other servers.
* Their shared hosting is great. I've never had any problems.
* Their customer service is great.
* The special coupon deals that I signed up with renewed the next year without me needing to ask or check.
